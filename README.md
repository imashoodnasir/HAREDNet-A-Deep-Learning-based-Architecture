# HAREDNet-A-Deep-Learning-based-Architecture
A hybrid recognition technique called HAREDNet is proposed, which has a) Encoder-Decoder Network (EDNet); b) improved Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (iSIFT), improved Gabor (iGabor) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO) techniques; c) Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (CvQDA); and d) weighted fusion strategy.
